# Unity2D_PolygoneGame_ReCreated
This project is a game played on hexagonal platforms that move along their edges. The objective of the game is to throw the randomly moving ball at opponents to deplete their lives. Each player has 3 lives. Players control their own platforms using the mouse.

## Game Features

- Hexagonal platforms: There are 5 hexagonal platforms that move along their edges.
- Randomly moving ball: The ball in the center moves randomly in different directions, and players must aim to hit opponents.
- Lives system: Each player starts with 3 lives, and losing a life occurs when a player fails to catch the ball.
- Events: Various events occur during the game, such as:
  - The ball suddenly ignites, making it move faster and increasing the speed of any platform it touches.
  - The ball turns into ice, freezing any platform it touches and rendering it immobile for a short period.
- Power-ups: Hearts occasionally appear, allowing players to collect them for extra lives.

## How to Play

- Use the mouse to control the movement of your platform.
- Aim to catch the ball and throw it at opponents to reduce their lives.
- Avoid missing the ball to prevent losing lives yourself.
- Collect hearts for extra lives.
